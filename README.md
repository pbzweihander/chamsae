```
DEBUG=true \
  DOMAIN=localhost \
  DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432 \
  OBJECT_STORE_TYPE=local_filesystem \
  OBJECT_STORE_LOCAL_FILE_BASE_PATH=./files/ \
  cargo run --bin chamsae
```

#### Example: Using CloudFlare R2 as object store

  DOMAIN=localhost \
  DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432 \
  OBJECT_STORE_TYPE=s3 \
  OBJECT_STORE_BUCKET=bucket \
  OBJECT_STORE_PUBLIC_URL_BASE=https://example.com/bucket \
  AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=auto \
  AWS_ENDPOINT=https://{account_id}.r2.cloudflarestorage.com \
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID={access_key} \
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY={secret_key} \
  cargo run --bin chamsae
```

#### Serve HTTPS with caddy
